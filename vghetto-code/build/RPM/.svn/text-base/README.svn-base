1. You'll need to create .rpmmacros file that contains the macro specifying the build path

a) Get your current path in which RPM directory is located in

e.g. 
[primp@build-centos RPM]$ pwd
/home/primp/src/RPM

b) Create .rpmmacros in your home directory with %_topdir to the path that was returned and append "rpm"

e.g.
	
[primp@build-centos RPM]$ cat ~/.rpmmacros

%_topdir        /home/primp/src/RPM/rpm	

You're now ready to build!

Build - This will perform build operation and generate an RPM in the current working directory
	./package build
Clean - This will clean up any previous files download or RPMs created
	./package clean
Checkout - This will only check out the scripts directory from repo
	./package checkout
